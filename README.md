VirtualSpin is a low-level Matter.js-based physics simulation of a Jaxcore Spin device, exposed as a shared JavaScript library that is used between multiple projects, such as the Jaxcore Spin Simulator and Spin-A-Sketch.

To run the Matter.js simulation, serve ./build/ with any web server.  With [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed type:

```
cd build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

For Windows:

```
cd build
python -m http.server
```

The library can be imported into other projects and use like this:

```
import VirtualSpin from 'jaxcore-virtual-spin';

let vspin = new VirtualSpin({
    friction: 0.1
});

vspin.on('spin', position) {
    // the spin event is equivalent to Jaxcore Spin's 32 pulses per revolution
    console.log('position = ' + position);
});

vspin.on('rotate', function(angle) {
    // the rotation event is generated by Matter.js and gives a precise angle in radians
    console.log('angle = '+angle);
});


vspin.start();

```
